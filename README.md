    02.01.24
    Main Things:
       - Updated Offsets
       - Aimbot Modes (NEW)
       - Colors Now Save
       - Saving issues fixed (mostly)
    Aimbot:
       - Aimbot Modes (NEW)
           - Cubic Bezier (xap-client) or Grinder (Credits: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/apex-legends/605888-grinder-simple-linux-sense-aimbot-triggerbot.html / https://github.com/arturzxc/grinder)
           - You may find Grinder to be more smooth, test around with them in the firing range
       - xap-client and Grinder have different options:
         Cubic Bezier (xap-client):
         - Prediction Toggles
         - Hitbox Selection
         - Closest To Crosshair
         Grinder:
         - Extra Smoothing By Distance
         - Deadzone
         - Advanced FOV
         - Advanced Min & Max Distance
         (Will add advanced FOV & Distance to Cubic Bezier (xap-client) mode in the future)
    Glow:
       - Color Saving
    ESP:
       - Color Saving
    Misc:
       - Super Grapple (Not sure how it works or even IF it works, but decided to add it anyway)

    Notes:
       - Grinder aimbot mode does not have a "simple" settings section; it only has advanced since I tried to do both and it didnt work?
       - Grinder's Team Check has not been tested (Same with xap-client, but it should work)
       - Weapon ESP sometimes wont work if the player is holding an heirloom (I dont have the IDs for them so I couldnt add them to it)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    28.01.24
    Main Things:
       - You no longer need to save config after enabling/disabling "Team Gamemode"

           - Applied to advanced aim settings aswell, dont worry.
    Triggerbot:
       - Added "Always On For Shotguns". If OnADS + Always On For Shotguns is enabled, then you dont need 
         to ADS with a shotgun to shoot with triggerbot, it will always shoot.
    Glow:
       - Added Shield Color Pickers
       - Added No Shield/Low HP Color Picker (Should fix players having the same color behind wall)
    Sense:
       - Updated Visibility Check
    Notes:
       - Glow Max Distance doesnt work (?)
       - For legit players I recommend not using Aimbot Prediction & RCS

# Help
**Features not working after changing them? (e.g. aim bind)**
Save config/Load config

**Aimbot not working?**

Check the speed/smoothness, keybind and if you have team gamemode on/off in the wrong mode

**ESP not working?**

Check team gamemode

So yeah, this thing was made by me, I was very bored so I took T_Tape's Menu and grinder's features and put them together to create this monstrosity. The code is still very messy so if you want to improve it, go ahead.
I'll will be very grateful if you do so.
